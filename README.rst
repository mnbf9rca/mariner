**If you are not running Firmware 4.4.3, then DO NOT install Mariner from this fork.  It is unlikely to
work.**

mnbf9rca: merged changes from both https://github.com/Desterly/mariner (encryption) and https://github.com/BlueFinBima/mariner (main work)

Installation
------------

Requires Python 3.x. Install as follows:
- libatlas-base-dev (for libcblas.so.3) - install with `sudo apt-get install -y libatlas-base-dev`
(from https://l9o.dev/posts/controlling-an-elegoo-mars-pro-remotely/)
- modify `/boot/config.txt` to add `dtoverlay=dwc2` to the end of the file
- enable the `dwc2` module by adding `modules-load=dwc2` to `/boot/cmdline.txt` just after `rootawait`
- create a file to store uploaded files. This creates a 2GB file and creates a file system on it - it can take quite some time to create the file. We then create a mountpoint.`:
```bash
sudo dd bs=1M if=/dev/zero of=/piusb.bin count=2048
sudo mkdosfs /piusb.bin -F 32 -I
sudo mkdir -p /mnt/usb_share
```
- add the following to `/etc/fstab`:
```
/piusb.bin /mnt/usb_share vfat users,gid=mariner,umask=002 0 2
```
- its important to check that the share mounts or it'll block boot: `sudo mount -a`
- update `/etc/rc.local` to load the `g_mass_storage` module on boot by adding the line `modprobe g_mass_storage file=/piusb.bin stall=0 ro=1` before `exit 0`. This command does that, or you can do it manually:
```bash
sudo sed -i 's/exit 0/modprobe g_mass_storage file=\/piusb.bin stall=0 removable=1 ro=0;\nexit 0/' /etc/rc.local
```


Check-out releases on this project for a deb file which can be installed if you're running 4.4.3.

Web interface for controlling MSLA 3D Printers based on ChiTu controllers
remotely.  This fork is to allow Mariner to work with Firmware 4.4.3 which had to be installed
in order to allow ChitBox 1.9 sliced files to be printed.  It was found that Mariner did not
work with this Firmware level because a number of the commands stopped working.

The issue with 4.4.3 was raised as https://github.com/luizribeiro/mariner/issues/453

- Remotely check print status: progress, current layer, time left.
- Remotely control the printer: start prints, pause/resume and stop.
- Browse files available for printing.
- Inspect ``.ctb`` files: image preview, print time and slicing settings.

For more details on the feature set, refer to our `Documentation
<https://mariner.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.
